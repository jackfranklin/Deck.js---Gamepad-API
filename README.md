#Deck.js + Gamepad API

Following on from a Barcamp Bournemouth talk from @robhawkes and with a
spare logitech gamepad available, I decided to take one of my favourite
new things, [Deck.js](http://imakewebthings.github.com/deck.js/), a
system for creating HTML presentations & mix it with some new cool
stuff, such as the [Gamepad API](https://wiki.mozilla.org/GamepadAPI).

##Notes
- I ran this in a specific Firefox nightly build that has the Gamepad API
enabled, which you can [find here for Mac, Win & Linux](http://people.mozilla.com/~tmielczarek/mouselock+gamepad/). Again, hat-tip to @robhawkes for that one.

- This __has not__ been tested in any other browser than the FF nightly
  linked above

- The basic code I started with is also @robhawkes's but I've since
  modified a lot of it. Credit is given in the comment of the file.
